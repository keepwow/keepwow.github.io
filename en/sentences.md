「佛陀或是耶稣坐在电脑和变速器的齿轮旁修行，会像坐在山顶和莲花座上一样自在。」 —— 『禅与摩托车维修艺术』

When you grow up you tend to get told that the world is the way it is. 
Your life is just to live your life inside the world, try not to bash into the walls too much, try to have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money. But life, that's a very limited life. Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact. And that is everything around you that you call life was made up by people, they were no smarter than you. And you can change it, you can influence it, you can build your own things that other people can use.

And the minute that you understand that you can poke life, and actually if you push in, something will pop out the other side. And you can change it, you can mold it. And that's maybe the most important thing. Life is there and you're just gonna live in it, versus embrace it, change it, improve it, make your mark upon it. I think that's very important and however you learn that, once you learn it, you'll want to change life and make it better 'cause it's kind of messed up in a lot of ways.
